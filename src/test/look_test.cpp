      This procedure reads the csv file, whose path is given, representing the
     gripper pose for each time and the directory, whose path is also give,
     containing images. Each line after the first one of the csv file must be of
     the form "t,x,y,z,qx,qy,qz,qw" where 't' is the time and other seven values
     represents the pose of gripper at the time 't'. Each file in the image
     directory must have a name of the form "[t].jpg" where [t] is the time when
     the image is looked

      Starting at the 'beginning'-th file in the image directory, this procedure
     reads 'number_of_images_to_send' images from the 'number_of_images_to_send'
     image files in the image directory and finds the corresponding gripper pose
     from csv file for each image. The client sends the look action call to the
     server for each image and repeat it 'number_of_turns' times.

      After each action call, this procedure prints the values of mean and
     covariance matrix of the pose distribution to ROS_INFO.
